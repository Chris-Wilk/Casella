I was tasked with creating a java project that worked like a short melee video game. Every time the game was ran the project would create two random characters of the three possible chracters and they would take turns fighing each other. Each character had three stats created at random: Intellegence, Dexterity, and Strength. The hitpoints for each chracter build is a set number. 

Complie/Run
In p004 directory
gradle run

Tests:
Throught the development of the project I would have the program output various things to the console. The biggest thing for me was having the characters stats output to confirm everything was being randomly generated within the correct amounts. Once the project was complete I ran multiple times with the characters atrributes shown to make sure I would get the expected outputs form the program.
